# DocBot
DocBot is a mobile application developed in React Native that helps users identify potential diseases based on their symptoms. The app has three screens: the first screen displays a list of doctors specialized in various medical fields, the second screen is a chatbot where users can enter their symptoms, and the third screen displays a list of doctors specialized in the identified disease.

The chatbot uses machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to identify potential diseases from a given set of data. The final output is determined by taking the mode of the outputs generated by all three algorithms.

With DocBot, users can easily and conveniently get an initial diagnosis and find doctors who specialize in treating their condition. It's a great tool for anyone looking to take charge of their health and well-being.
